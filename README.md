MSU Coursework for a Data Science Class

I chose this dataset because it has many, many columns of NCAAM data to work with, over 150 to be specific. As for the IDA/EDA, some of the statistics, including position-based scoring and experience, are missing, likely because the data was not tracked up until recently. 
Some columns had yes or no values, so those were changed to 1 and 0 respectively, and there is a column defining which postseason tournament the team made, and the ideal goal is if they made March Madness, to put a 1, and if not, then 0. 
I've tried a few plots with streamlit, such as correlation heatmaps, and customizable histograms and scatterplots. I still have plenty to learn, but I look forward to it.
